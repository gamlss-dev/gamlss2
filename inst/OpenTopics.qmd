## Open Topics

1. Should `GAIC()` and `Rsq()` be generic functions? At the moment the functions are overwitten from _gamlss_ when loading _gamlss2_.

2. Should the `pb()` model term also be overwitten?

3. Which model terms do we need `re()`, `lasso()`, etc.?

4. Which strategies should we use in stepwise()? At the moment the
   function uses "forward.linear", "forward", "backward" and "replace".
